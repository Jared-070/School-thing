Ahh... free at last. O Gabriel, now dawns thy reckoning, and thy gore shall GLISTEN before the temples of Man! Creature of Steel, my gratitude upon thee for my freedom. But the crimes thy kind have committed against humanity are NOT forgotten! And thy punishment... is DEATH!
A visitor... Mmmm... Indeed. I have slept long enough. The kingdom of Heaven has long since forgotten my name, and I am EAGER to make them remember. However, the blood of Minos stains your hands, and I must admit, I'm curious about your skills, Weapon. And so, before I tear down the cities, and crush the armies of Heaven... you, shall do as an appetizer. Come forth, child of man, and DIE.
HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.
